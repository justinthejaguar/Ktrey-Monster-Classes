This is a Foundry VTT compendium which incorporates the classes of D4Caltrops Monster classes by Ktrey. These classes are perfect for a player who just wants to play a monster from the traditional games or
great for creating unorthodox retainers for your players. I encourage you to visit the D4 Caltrops blog and check out the classes https://blog.d4caltrops.com/2021/11/monster-character-class-options.html
and take the time to see the many many tables Ktrey has put together for players to enjoy!

Each has its own abilities and journal entry for progression contained.

For any questions on the module reach out on Discord to: Jaguar#8265

Additionally, I'd like to make sure to mention the contributors below for the workflow that I use for this module: https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/FoundryVTT-Module-Template/graphs/contributors
